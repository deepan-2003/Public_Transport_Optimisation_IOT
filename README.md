# Public_Transport_Optimisation_IOT
It is IOT based public transport optimization project
**Problem Definition:**
 Public transportation systems play a crucial role in modern cities by reducing traffic
 congestion, minimizing environmental impact, and providing affordable mobility options.
 However, these systems often face challenges such as inefficiency, overcrowding, and limited
 accessibility, which can lead to user dissatisfaction and decreased ridership. To address these
 issues and enhance the overall quality of public transport services, we propose an IoT-based
 project aimed at optimizing public transportation systems.
Running Your Website (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript):

1. Web Server Setup:
   - Install a web server on your local machine, such as Apache, Nginx, XAMPP, or WampServer.

2. Website Directory:
   - Create a directory where you will place your website files.

3. File Placement:
   - Move your website files (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript) into the directory created in step 2.

4. Configuration (PHP, if applicable):
   - Review your PHP code and make sure database connections and other configurations are set for your local environment.

5. Start the Web Server:
   - Start your web server to make your website accessible. The default web root directory might be htdocs or www in XAMPP or WampServer.

6. Access Your Website:
   - Open a web browser and enter http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1 in the address bar to access your website.

7. Testing:
   - Test your website's functionality to ensure it's working as expected.

Running Your Node.js Server:

1. Server Directory:
   - Navigate to the directory where your Node.js server code is located.

2. Dependencies Installation:
   - In the terminal, run the following commands to install the required Node.js dependencies:
 
   npm install
  
3. Start the Node.js Server:
   - Run the Node.js server using the following command:

   node server.js
   
4. Access the Server:
   - Your Node.js server should now be running. You can access it at http://localhost:PORT, where PORT is the port specified in your server code.

Running Your Arduino Code:

1. Arduino IDE:
   - Open the Arduino IDE on your local machine.

2. Open Code:
   - Navigate to File > Open and select the Arduino code file from your message folder.

3. Connect Arduino:
   - Connect your Arduino device to your computer using a USB cable.

4. Configure Board and Port:
   - In the Arduino IDE, go to the Tools menu and select the appropriate Arduino board and port.

5. Upload Code:
   - Click the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE to upload the code to your Arduino device.

6. Monitor Serial Output (if applicable):
   - If your Arduino code sends data to the serial monitor, open the Arduino IDE's serial monitor to view the output.

7. Testing:
   - Test your Arduino code to ensure it functions as expected.

By following these steps, you can run your website, Node.js server, and Arduino code on your localhost for testing and development purposes. Make sure you have the required software and dependencies installed for each component of your project.
